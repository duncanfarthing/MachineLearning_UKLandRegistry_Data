This project is really just to get a better feel for imputing data using MICE (Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations) and Random Forest with a real world dataset. 

I'm testing with UK Land Registry open dataset for HPI (House Price Index) initially. There are real world gaps in housing stock in the defined geograpic regions for example areas where there no apartments currently to generate price indexes and want to see how realistically can we impute those values. This processeing will enable better national analysis and comparison and futher enable prediction of investment performance for future developements as a next step.

Using a Medallion Architecture for the data to help keep things organised and to make transfer to a lakehouse smoother should I want to later
