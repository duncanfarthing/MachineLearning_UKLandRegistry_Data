This project is really just to get a better feel for imputing data using MICE (Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations) and Random Forest. 

I've chosen to test with UK Land Registry open dataset for HPI (House Price Index)

I'm using a Medallion Architecture to help keep things organised and to make transfer to a lakehouse smoother should the need arise
